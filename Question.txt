"You are given N (1 <= N <= 2*10^5) and M bidirectional edges (1 <= M <= 2*10^5). Each edge has a cost, c_i. A path U --> V is defined as a sequence of distinct edges from node U to node V. The cost of a path is defined as the maximum cost over all edges in the path.

Your task is to find a path from node 1 to node N with minimum cost.

Input format:
The first line will consist of integers N and M.
The next M lines will consist of 3 integers, u, v, and c, which represents an edge connecting u and v of cost c.

Sample input:
4 6
1 2 1
2 3 1
3 4 1
1 2 3
3 4 2
1 4 3

Output Format:
One integer that is the minimum cost of a path from node 1 to node N

Sample Output:
1
